The ninth Endowed Professorship at the Ohio State University was established
in July 1975 after the approval of the Board of Trustees. This is known as
the <b>Robert  M. Critchfield Professorship in Engineering</b>, supported by
a large bequest by the late Robert M. Critchfield, EE'16, former Vice
President of <a href=http://www.gmc.com/> General Motors Corp.</a>,
who died in December, 1973.

Appointment to this Professorship is upon recommendation of the Dean of the
College of Engineering to the Provost and with approval by the Trustees
of the Ohio State University. Selection is made from the faculty of
the College of Engineering, preferably from the electrical engineering faculty
when the fund was initially established. Recently, a selection can also be
made
from computer
engineering and computer science faculty. An appointment of a senior
faculty to this endowed chair
professorship is a special honor and recognition to the faculty's
achievement as an
eminent scholar and educator. Endowed chair professors are one of the highest
honors bestowed on senior-level professors in U.S. universities. Income from
the endowment can be used at the chairholder's discretion for various
research activities.

Robert M. Critchfield was born in 1890 in Columbus, Ohio. He had been known as
a "hard worker" since his boyhood. Young Critchfield got his first part-time
job while still in elementary school. He had a newspaper route, delivering
papers to North Side homes.
<p>

After Critchfield entered high school at North High School in Columbus, he took
a job where his interest in mechanics and electricity could be utilized. Many
of his after-school hours were spent at the Citizens Telephone Co,, repairing
instruments in its shop.
<p>

Critchfield entered the Ohio State University in 1911, majoring in electrical
engineering, where he was an excellent student. He became a member
of Alpha Tau Omega and Lambda Phi Omega social fraternities,
and was elected to Eta Kappa Nu,
electrical engineering honorary, and Sigma Xi, scientific honorary society.
Whenever Critchfield had any spare time, he would be in the phone company's
shop or installing its equipment in Columbus homes.
<p>

Critchfield was not able to take part in much extracurricular activity on
campus because most of his efforts were directed toward study or his job.
However, he did manage some participation. He headed a group which founded a
co-op book store for engineering students; and
was chosen to supervise one of the
Electrical Shows produced by electrical engineering juniors and seniors
every other year.
<p>

The heavy-scheduled young man decided on track as the outlet  for his athletic
interest. He made the team and later was upped to the varsity. A pulled
cartilage in his ankle shortly after getting on the first string forced him
to drop the sport.
<p>

When Critchfield received his B.S. degree in Electrical Engineering at Ohio
State, in 1916, he learned from his phone company foreman that he had worked
the equivalent of five solid years during after school hours and vacation
with the company. This remarkable amount of part-time work occurred in the
eight-year period he was in high school and the University.
<p>

After his graduation from Ohio State, Critchfield went to work for
Westinghouse Electric and Manufacturing Co. in East Pittsburgh, Pa. With the
advent of World War I, Critchfield left Westinghouse to enlist in the U.S.
Navy as an electrician, first class. He was soon promoted to ensign, then to
lieutenant (j.g.). He was stationed in Washington D.C., at various navy yards
and worked on early Naval fire control operations.
<p>

In 1919, after the war ended, Critchfield joined the Owen-Dyneto Corp. in
Syracuse, N.Y., as an assistant engineer. He began his long association with the
General Motors Corp. two years later (1921) when he went with his Remy
Electric Division in Anderson, Ind. He was named assist chief engineer of the
division which became Delco-Remy in 1933, chief engineer in 1936 and factory
manager in 1947.
<p>

Under the leadership of Critchfield, <a href=http://www.delcoremy.com/>
Delco-Remy</a> developed and produced  many electrical items for aircraft
during World War II. These included automatic pilots, engine controls,
generators, batteries and voltage regulators. In 1951, he was promoted to
assistant manager of General Motors' Allison Division, producer of
aircraft engines and aviation equipment, in Indianapolis. In 1954, Critchfield
became the general manager of the Pontiac Motor Division in Pontiac, Michigan.
He was also appointed as vice president of the General Motors.
<p>

In June 1956, the General Motors executive, returned to his home University in
his home town, Columbus, where he started his hardworking and successful
career as a newpaper boy. This time, he received the <a
href=https://engineering.osu.edu/awards/content/benjamin-g.-lamme-meritorious-achievement-medal>
Benjamin G. Lamme Medal</a>, the
highest honor Ohio State bestows upon its distinguished alumni in engineering
and technical arts, in recognition of his meritorious achievement in the field
of engineering.
