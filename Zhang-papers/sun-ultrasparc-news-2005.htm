            <p class="announce-title">Sun Formally Acknowledges the Research 
            Contribution of Z. Zhang, Z. Zhu, and X. Zhang to the Memory System 
            Design in UltraSPARC IIIi Processor </p>
            <p>A permutation-based memory interleaving technique, called "XOR 
            interleaving" or "permutation interleaving" proposed by Zhao Zhang 
            (Ph.D.'02), Zhichun Zhu (Ph.D.'03), and Xiaodong Zhang has been 
            adopted in the Sun MicroSystems' UltraSPARC IIIi processor. A paper 
            about this technique entitled "A permutation-based page interleaving 
            scheme to reduce row-buffer conflicts and exploit data locality" was 
            presented and published in the 33rd Annual IEEE/ACM International 
            Symposium on Microarchitecture (Micro-33, pp. 32-41, Monterey, 
            California, December 10-13, 2000). Having conducted intensive 
            experiments and thorough analyses, the three W&amp;M researchers 
            showed that address mapping conflicts at the cache level, including 
            address conflicts and write-back conflicts, will inevitably 
            propagate to the memory address space under a standard memory 
            interleaving method, causing a significant memory access delay. This 
            important finding was first published in this Micro-33 paper, and 
            their proposed permutation interleaving technique effectively solves 
            the conflict problem with a trivial hardware cost. In addition to 
            supporting the XOR interleaving technique in UltraSPARC IIIi 
            processors, the finding of memory address conflict propagations in 
            the Micro-33 paper has also been quoted in Technical Manuals of 
            UltraSPARC IIIi processor related systems by the Sun MicroSystems. 
            </p>
            <p>In July 2005, the Sun MicroSystems Inc. sent a <a href="Sun-letter.pdf">formal 
            acknowledgement letter</a> to the College of William and Mary to 
            recognize the research contribution of Z. Zhang, Z. Zhu, and X. 
            Zhang. The UltraSPARC IIIi processors are used in in both entry 
            level servers, such as Sun Fire V210, V240, V250, and V440 servers, 
            and in workstation and desktop products, such as Sun Blade 1500 
            workstations. </p>
            <p>Xiaodong Zhang, Lettie Pate Evans Professor of Computer Science 
            and the Department Chair, says, "I and my former students Zhao Zhang 
            (an assistant professor of electrical and computer engineering at 
            the Iowa State University) and Zhichun Zhu (an assistant professor 
            of electrical and computer engineering at the University of Illinois 
            at Chicago) feel very rewarding to see the strong impact of our 
            research work to the computer industry and to our daily computing 
            operations". </p><!------------------- do not edit below this line --------------------><!-- bottom details are the same from here to next comment for each page--><br>
