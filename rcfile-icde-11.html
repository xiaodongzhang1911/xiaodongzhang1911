<title> RCFile Data Placement Structure</title>

<center><h3>RCFile has become a standard data format for both conventional
databases and for big data warehouse
systems</h3> </center>

<b>Background</b><br>
The basic data structure of a relational database consists of a
two-dimensional table organized in rows and collumns. There are two
basic data formats to store the tables in computer systems: <i>row-store</i>
and <i>column-store</i>. Row-store forms a table in a sequence of rows
(or records) with two advantages: (1) It is easy to add or
update rows or records, which are basic operations to modify,
grow or shrink the
table; and (2) all the columns in a row or a record are stored together,
which is desirable for applications to access a complete record. A
major disadvantage of the row-store format is related to I/O efficiency. Since
all the columns of a row have to be read although only a few columns may be
used in practice, particularly for a very wide table. Another disadvantage
is that a row-based data compression may not be as efficient as that on
a column-based one.
<p>
The two disadvantages can be addressed by the column-store format that forms
a table in a sequence of columns with two advantages: (1) Only required
columns are read from the storage during the selection process of a query;
and (2) a high compression rate
can be achieved due to similar data types in a column.
Two disadvantages are associated with the column-store format. First, if the
result of a query needs operations among multiple
columns that may be stored in
different tracks in a disk, or even worse in different nodes connected by
networks, significant delays may come from random accesses in disks or/and
remote accesses via networks. Second, it is not easy for write intensive
workloads where rows or records are frequently added/deleted and updated.
<p>
As data volume becomes increasinly large, the tables have to be partitioned
and placed
among many computing nodes in clusters. Thus, a pure row-store or column-store
would not be efficient for processing tables in a distributed way
in large clusters.
<p>

<b> The RCFile Data Format</b><br>
The RCFile (Row Columnar File) data format is designed and implemented for
data processing in distributed systems. RCfile is a hybrid data format that
forms a table in a sequence row groups. A row group consists of multiple
rows. Furtherfore, each row group is partitioned into columns.
In this way, the RCFile format has the merits of both row-store and
column-store, which is particularly desirable for big data processing
in clusters.
<p>

<b>The Usage of RCFile in Various Data Processing Systems</b><br>
RCFile has been used in several major big data systems, including HBase, Hive,
HCatelog, Impala, Pig, Presto, and others. Conventional databases have also
been enabled to access data in the RCFile format,
including IBM database, Microsoft SQL Server,
Oracle database, SAS in-database products, Teradata and others.
